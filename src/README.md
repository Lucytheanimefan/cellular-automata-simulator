Put your source code, resources, and property files here.


* Need to add instance variable to Cell to track number of survivals of fish and sharks  
* GUI handles Catching fire outside border    

To do (Wednesday):  
* Lucy: add play, pause, step forward button, need to test simulations, WaTor  
* Phil: Segregation  
* Yumin: Catching Fire, write output to file  

* need to distinguish between simulations by simulation title rather than manually changing simulation topic  

Ask TA:   
* random initial state? Or does it have to be in the XML file?  

Distant goals:  
* Use fish and shark images for WaTor
