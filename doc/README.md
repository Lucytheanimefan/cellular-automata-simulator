- any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
- Files used to test the project: Main class, and all the xml inputs in data folder 
- Data or resource files required by the project: they are included in data folder, and we also have an English resouce file for the constant strings
- any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
All you need to do is run the program. A file directory chooser should pop up, where you select a particular simulation's xml file. From there, you just use the GUI to change simulation or grid shape, etc.
- any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
None that we know of
- any extra features included in the project
* Updating graph
* Three extra simulations (sugar, slimemold, foraging ants)
* Clicking the grid cells to change state
* Saving simulation to an xml file
* Changing the grid shapes
- your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
It was fun, but during the week of extensions, time management became more difficult as other classes just so happened to decide to have midterms.
