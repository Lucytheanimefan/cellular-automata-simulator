Refactoring the Code
--

Based on the results from style check and AnalytiX we have solved all the magic number issue by changing them to be the constant variables. 

We have aslo factor all the duplicated codes to be a separate function.

We are planning to move initSimulation methods from CA class to SceneManager class.
